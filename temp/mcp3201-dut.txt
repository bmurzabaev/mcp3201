Connections:

Uno:          MCP:
5V            1, 8
GND           3, 4
              2 (Unknown voltage)
13            7
12            6
9             5

clocks data out on the falling edge of clock
compatible with both SPI Mode 0,0 (clock idles low) and SPI Mode 1,1 (clock idles high)
MSB is clocked out first on the falling edge of the 3rd clock pulse
